# Magic Mirror
The MagicMirror project is an interactive web server that displays different informative modules. It includes modules such as time, weather, news, and Spotify. While making the MagicMirror, I faced challenges such as understanding and learning code. One of my most memorable triumphs was installing a third party Sportify module. While installing that module, I made alot of mistakes with the code and it took nearly an hour to figure out what I was doing wrong. But once the module ws installed, I was happy to see that it was displayed well on my screen. In the endd, I am very staisfied with how I was able to create and personalize my MagicMirror.

# Final Milestone

- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE
For my final milestone, I managed to install a new 3rd party module. It is a spotify module that displayed what song was beign currently palyed and when nothing is being played, it displayed some of the artists I listen to. I was also able to move around and adjust the size of modules so they would'nt overlap. I was also able to decorate my magic mirror by placing it in a small picture frame. This pricture frame protect the display screen from being scratched or damaged.  My biggest challenge in making the MagicMirror was the simple mistakes I made when first configuring my module files. A simple error such as the accidental placement on a equal sign or question mark caused the code not to work. Throguhout the whole process of putting the MagicMirrior together, I learned alot about coding.  In the future< i hope to learn more Javascript and expand my coding skills. 


# Second Milestone

For my second milestone, my goal was to personalize the default MagicMirror modules. For the weather module, I was able to change the temperture units from celcius to farenheight. I also managed to personalize the calender module and connect it to my personal google calendar. The biggest change I made for all the modules was changing the colors and the fonts of the texts.  A challenge that I faced in this milestone was figuring out in what files to configure the code. For example, when I tried to change the location of my weather module, I was unsure whether to configure it in the "config.js"  or "weather.js" file. After scrolling and looking through both of the files I settled on trying to configure the code in the "comfig.js" file because it mentioned latitude and longitute. Once I changed the lagitude and longitude to the coordinates I wanted, the screen displayed the specfic city I wanted. I continued to face this challenge as I tried configuring different modules. For my next milestone, I want to a new module. 

# First Milestone

For my first milestone, I aimed to set up  my Raspberry Pi and magic mirror display screen which are integral parts of the projects. The Rasberry Pi serves as a computer to run and install code on the 7 inch monitor. The 7 inch monitor acts as a display for the smart mirror and as the device where the code is edited and installed. I managed to install the node.js code onto the display screeen using trial and error. The first challenege I was the installation of the Rasberrry Pi. Since it was my first time working with a Rasberry Pi, I took my time understanding the purpose of the Rasberry Pi and how to install it. Once the Rasberry Pi  was installed , I managed to power on the display monitor screen and begin on installing code. I then began to install the "node.js" code into the Rasperry Pi montor. When I first attempted to install the code, I did so without the "sudo" command. I was unsure of why the terminal was telling me there was an error. After consulting my instructor, I added the "sudo" command where it was needed and the code worked. After that I installed the smart mirror application. Once the application was installed, the monitor screen displayed the smart mirror. The smart mirror included the time, date, weather, and news. My next goal will be to add and edit modules. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
