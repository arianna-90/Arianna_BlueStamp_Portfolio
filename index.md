# Smart Mirror
Replace this text with a brief description (2-3 sentences) of your project. This description should draw the reader in and make them interested in what you've built. You can include what the biggest challenges, takeaways, and triumphs from completing the project were. As you complete your portfolio, remember your audience is less familiar than you are with all that your project entails!

You should comment out all portions of your portfolio that you have not completed yet, as well as any instructions:
```HTML 
<!--- This is an HTML comment in Markdown -->
<!--- Anything between these symbols will not render on the published site -->
```

For your final milestone, explain the outcome of your project. Key details to include are:
- What you've accomplished since your previous milestone
- What your biggest challenges and triumphs were at BSE
- A summary of key topics you learned about
- What you hope to learn in the future after everything you've learned at BSE

For your second milestone, explain what you've worked on since your previous milestone. You can highlight:
- Technical details of what you've accomplished and how they contribute to the final goal
- What has been surprising about the project so far
- Previous challenges you faced that you overcame
- What needs to be completed before your final milestone

For my first milestone, I aimed to set up  my Raspberry Pi and magic mirror display screen which are integral parts of the projects. The Rasberry Pi serves as a computer to run and install code on the 7 inch monitor. The 7 inch monitor acts as a display for the smart mirror and as the device where the code is edited and installed. I managed to install the node.js code onto the display screeen using trial and error. The first challenege I was the installation of the Rasberrry Pi. Since it was my first time working with a Rasberry Pi, it took my tiunderstanding the purpose of the Rasberry Pi and how to install it. Once the Rasberry Pi  was installed , I managed to power on the display monitor screen and begin on installing code. My first was to install the "node.js" code into the rasperry pi montor. When I first attempted to install the code, I did so without the "sudo" command. I was unsure of why the terminal was tellign me there was an error. After consulting my instructor, I added the "sudo" command where it was needed and the code worked. After that I installed the magicmirror application. Once the apllication was installed, the monitor screen displayed the smart mirror. The smart mirror included the time, date, weather, and news. My next goal will be to add and edit modules. 

# Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs. 

```c++
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

# Bill of Materials
Here's where you'll list the parts in your project. To add more rows, just copy and paste the example rows below.
Don't forget to place the link of where to buy each component inside the quotation marks in the corresponding row after href =. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize this to your project needs.

# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
- [Example 1](https://trashytuber.github.io/YimingJiaBlueStamp/)
- [Example 2](https://sviatil0.github.io/Sviatoslav_BSE/)
- [Example 3](https://arneshkumar.github.io/arneshbluestamp/)
